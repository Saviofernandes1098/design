            <p>After a few team discussions, we all realized we were interested in social media, and more specifically the negative effects in can have on its users. As college students and members of Gen-Z, we were all well acquainted with this social issue, and wished there was a way to lessen this negative impact. We decided this should be our focus for the semester. After all, if you want something to exist, you have to make it yourself!</p>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>As a team, we began by researching existing studies and articles on social media addiction. We found that social media leads to many negative outcomes for students, such as poor academic performance, poor mental health, stress, and sleep problems. One alarming statistic we found was that <b>college students who use social media for over 5 hours a day drop one letter grade on average.</b> Additionally, one in three college students feel like they're wasting their time on social media.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, we learned that, for our interviewees, healthy social media use was not defined by the amount of time spent using it. Instead, it was related to how social media was used. Healthy social media use meant having genuine, human interactions on it. It meant only consuming the content that one was looking to consume, and not getting sidetracked.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <p>Some of our students also told us that they had attempted different methods of using social media less, but had eventually relapsed. They also mentioned that they felt less productive when they spent their time "doomscrolling", and that this would take time away from their academic and social lives.</p>

            <h3>Journey Map</h3>
            <p>As users scroll, they are aware that they have other tasks to do, but they still choose to continue scrolling. Other negative emotions also appear, such as a feeling of missing their friends, envy of others' lives, boredom, or frustration. <b>By the time they exit social media, they have wasted a lot of time, and they feel stressed and regretful.</b></p>

            <p>After conducting our research and understanding the problem more deeply, we narrowed down the scope of our problem. We realized that the focus should be on helping help students who struggled with a lack of awareness of how long they stay scrolling mindlessly on social media.</p>
            <p>Our problem statement thus became:<b> How might we encourage college students to change their social media habits, so that they utilize it for more enriching purposes?</b></p>

            <h3>Solution ideation</h3>
            <p>One of the ideas that came up was, in fact, suggested in one of our interviews. When asked what their ideal social media app would look like, they suggested a "tunnel vision" feature, which would ask users what they had come to the app for, and only show them the part of the app they chose. For example, if a user wanted to just see their DMs, the app would direct them to that section of the app. This would avoid getting distractions and doomscrolling. We were interested in this proposal and decided to test out its potential.</p>

            <h3>First digital prototype</h3>
            <p>We decided that our app would primarily focus on user statistics. When users entered the app, they could select a goal to set for the day on social media, such as finding inspiration, chatting with friends, etc. Alternatively, they could simply track their screen time.</p>
            <p>As users perused social media, the app would send notifications informing them of how on-task they had been so far. The app could analyze what activities the user was engaging in on social media, such as the content of the posts or the features that were being used (Reels, DMs, etc). Based on that data, the app would estimate how on-track the user had been with their set goal. The app featured a statistics page where users could see information for their daily progress.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the app included a rewards page, which incentivized users to remain on task through discounts and gift cards. The goal was to gamify the experience.</p>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>The main insight we discovered was that the app was confusing to use. It was overly complicated, and people needed an explanation of the stats system, as well as the notifications. We realized that an onboarding process would be necessary for first-time users. Additionally, the app may need to be simplified.</p>
            <p>Another discovery was that users felt the app was too invasive. They felt uncomfortable at the idea of an app that tracks what they do and can see what types of content they consume -- they felt observed. With this in mind, we knew the app had to wok differently.</p>
            <p>Additionally, users appreciated the "just relax" option, as it was not as restrictive as other regulatory apps. However, they felt the feature was counter-productive, as many users would likely just end up choosing that option every time without thinking. We decided that we needed a way to encourage selecting the other options instead, while also not completely restricting access to the full social media platform.</p>

            <h3>What worked?</h3>
            <p>Overall, I think this project turned out to be quite successful. My team and I created an app that I feel proud of, and which I genuinely think would be useful if it were real (I have found myself wishing it was real!). I think we were quite thorough in our process, and we were not afraid to change our prototype when our initial ideas weren't working. This allowed us to keep our goal and the users' needs in consideration, and I think that made for a successful final product.</p>
